Build instructions: make expr

How to run my project’s program:

1. Input the test expressions into the textfile named "input.txt" which is included in the .zip file.
(I have already included some test expression examples. Please delete them and replace them with your own if you wish.)
2. After building the project using the ‘make’ command, please type in “./expr” into the console to run my project.
3. Enjoy!
