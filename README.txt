Project 2: Grammars and Parsing

(a) No collaborators. Work done independently.

(b) Build instructions:
make expr

(c) How to run my project’s program:

1. Input the test expressions into the textfile named "input.txt" which is included in the .zip file.
(I have already included some test expression examples. Please delete them and replace them with your own if you wish.)
2. After building the project using the ‘make’ command, please type in “./expr” into the console to run my project.
3. Enjoy!

P.S. My project was written on a MacBook Air 2015, but I used docker to use gcc on Fedora Linux. Please use gcc on Fedora Linux to grade. Thanks.
